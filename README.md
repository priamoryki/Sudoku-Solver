# Sudoku-Solver
This is Sudoku-Solver based on Python. At the moment, only the usual solution [algorithms](https://bbf.ru/magazine/26/7372/ "Only some of them") have been implemented.  
You can see their essence here when I get my hands on them :).  

# Code pros and cons
* The code is not divided into classes (I will fix this when I add a convenient user interface)
* There are places in which the code is repeated (it must be put into a separate function)
* Generalized to large Sudoku boards
* It's pretty clear what's going on inside the various functions
